HEY READ THIS!!


so in 2017 these guys made a program called pyvesc. it was awesome, it worked, but it's like SUPER broken. fucked up REAL BAD. So broken you cant use it anymore.
tried it. didnt work.

some dude took the whole vescuart deal and threw it into a single file, working with python.
motor.py is that file.


TO USE:

1. turn on your computer

2. plug in battery to the VESC

3. plug vesc USB into computer

4. open vesc tool

5. you will see the connect button, and around there you will see a piece of text that looks like "COM6" or "COM5"
    whatever that mumber is, you take that and type it into the program where the current com value is. that is the serial identifier of your vesc. without it, you can't connect to it!. DONT TRY TO BS IT YOU WILL FUCK THINGS UP REAL BAD.
